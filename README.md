Formatted citations
===================
This script finds meta-tags for Google Scholar's indexer on a website and
creates a dialog with formatted citations for APA and BibTeX. 

How-to
------
To use this script just include *cite.js* in your .html file and copy the html for the dialog. When this is done just press the button *Cite this paper* to see the dialog with the formatted citations.

A demo of the script can be seen in *demo.html*

The script was made for [OpenPsych](http://openpsych.net) where you can [see it
in action](http://openpsych.net/ODP/2014/07/ethnicrace-differences-in-aptitude-by-generation-in-the-united-states-an-exploratory-meta-analysis/).
